# Workday-Schedule
This is going to be a work-day schedule that saves the users input. At the end of the day you can clear the day and start a new planner on the next work day.


this is going to be a work day planner that logs users input and is activated to where after that hour passes the color changes and lets you know what hour you are on. Grey is past hour, green is current future hour, and red is current hour. I used input group in the html to set the sections for the time and save button in the row.
